## Introduction 
This library provides a comprehensive Python implementation of core **Graph Theory** concepts from **Discrete Mathematics**. It allows you to create and analyze graphs represented by vertices and edges, with functionalities including generating **adjacency matrices**, **path matrices**, **weight matrices**, performing **graph coloring**, and more. With this toolkit, you can easily explore, and manipulate various graph structures in a simple and intuitive way.

## Basic Terminologies
- **Graph** ‚Üí A collection of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (links).
- **Adjacency Matrix** ‚Üí A square matrix showing which vertices are connected by an edge.
- **Incidence Matrix** ‚Üí A matrix showing the relation between vertices and edges.
- **Path Matrix (Connectivity Matrix)** ‚Üí A matrix that indicates whether a path exists between any two vertices.
- **Weight Matrix (Cost Matrix)** ‚Üí A matrix showing edge weights (like distances or costs) between vertices.
- **Path** ‚Üí A sequence of vertices connected by edges (edges may or may not repeat).
- **Simple Path** ‚Üí A path where no vertex (and hence no edge) is repeated.
- **Trail** ‚Üí A walk where edges are not repeated, but vertices may repeat.
- **Cycle (or Circuit)** ‚Üí A closed path where the start and end vertices are the same, with no repetition of edges/vertices (except start = end).
- **Euler Path** ‚Üí A path that uses every edge exactly once.
- **Euler Circuit (Euler Graph)** ‚Üí A cycle that uses every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.
- **Hamiltonian Path** ‚Üí A path that visits every vertex exactly once.
- **Hamiltonian Cycle** ‚Üí A cycle that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the start.
- **Connected Graph** ‚Üí A graph where there‚Äôs a path between every pair of vertices.
- **Complete Graph** ‚Üí A graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
- **Bipartite Graph** ‚Üí A graph whose vertices can be split into two disjoint sets with edges only across sets.
- **Tree** ‚Üí A connected graph with no cycles.
- **Spanning Tree** ‚Üí A subgraph that connects all vertices with minimum edges and no cycles.

## Usage

open command prompt and run:
```python
pip install graphtk
```

## Syntax and Methods
1Ô∏è‚É£ Input Format: Vertices and Edges
```
vertices = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'] # list

# list of tuples
edges = [
    ("A", "B"),
    ("A", "B"),
    ("A", "C"),
    ("A", "C"),
    ("A", "D"),
    ("B", "D"),
    ("C", "D")
]
```
- Implementation
```
from graphtk.toolkit import Toolkit

tk = Toolkit()

vertices = ['A', 'B', 'C']
edges = tk.edges(vertices, True) # You can also provide your own edges; just ensure they follow the correct format.
print(edges)
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Adjacency Matrix, Path Matrix, Weight Matrix, B-Matrix
- Syntax
```
adjacency_matrix(edges: list, vertices: list, is_directed: bool)
weight_matrix(edges: list, vertices: list, is_directed: bool = None)
```
- Implementation 
```
from graphtk.toolkit import Toolkit

tk = Toolkit()

vertices = ['A', 'B', 'C']
edges = [('A', 'A'), ('A', 'A'), ('A', 'A'), ('A', 'A'), ('A', 'A'), ('A', 'A'), ('A', 'A'), ('A', 'B'), ('A', 'B'), ('A', 'B'), ('A', 'B'), ('A', 'B'), ('B', 'B'), ('B', 'B'), ('C', 'A')]

# adjacency matrix
matrix = tk.adjacency_matrix(edges, vertices, True)
print(matrix)

# path matrix
matrix = tk.path_matrix(edges, vertices)

# weight matrix
matrix = tk.weight_matrix(edges, vertices)

# B-matrix
matrix = tk.b_matrix(edges, vertices)
```
